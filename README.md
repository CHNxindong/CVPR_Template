# CVPR Template

Latex template for IEEE CVPR submission, rebuttal, and final version. The last version of CVPR latex template has been developed by Paolo.Ienne@di.epfl.ch and awf@acm.org about 15 years ago. The previous version suffer from several issues:
1. Authors needs several individual files: cvpr.sty, cvpr_eso.sty, eso-pic.sty.
2. For cvpr rebuttal another verison of cvpr.cls is required.
3. Several warnings exists due to depreiciated options.

This style file is intended to be used as a single style file that could help to fuild review, rebuttal and final files with a single style file, simply by using one of the following commands:
\documentclass[review]{cvpr}
\documentclass[rebuttal]{cvpr}
\documentclass[final]{cvpr}

Acknowledge: this file is modified from the the old cvpr template files contributed by Paolo.Ienne@di.epfl.ch and awf@acm.org.
